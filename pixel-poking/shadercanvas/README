## Notes

- One thing that you do need to know is that whatever windowing solution you use needs to support the raw-window-handle (opens new window) crate.
- "Support for web"
- The instance is the first thing you create when using wgpu. Its main purpose is to create Adapters and Surfaces.
- Every pixel in the result image gets at least one fragment.
