# Speed comparisons for various 'filter' implementations

The filter should read lines from stdin, print them back to stdout -- and end
with the sum of all line lengths.

## input.txt

- lines are between 0 and 500 chars long
- all lines end with unicode
- there are one million lines
- there are no 'tricky' lines

## variations

- 'a' should be naive straight-forward implementation
- 'b+' can be alternative / more sofisticated things
